# t3 - QLearning Comparison for Tic-Tac-Toe
Part of homework for ENPM808F Robot Learning, Fall 2017 at the University of Maryland

Performs training and evaluation of a Table based and a Neural Network based approach to QLearning on a
Tic Tac Toe game

## Assignment Details
1) Program a Tic-Tac-Toe game. Assign a reward of +1 for a win (X wins), -1 for a loss (O wins), and 0 otherwise. 
   Have it train itself to play through self-play and Q-learning. Use a table to store the Q-values. 
   Does it achieve an optimal policy?

2) Replace the Q-value table with a functional approximation, such as a neural network. 
   Compare the results of Q-learning using the table representation with those achieved using your functional approximation.
