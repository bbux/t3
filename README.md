Deep Learning for Tic Tac Toe

Attempt to learn a policy for playing tic tac toe using Q-Learning.

## Assignment Details
1) Program a Tic-Tac-Toe game. Assign a reward of +1 for a win (X wins), -1 for a loss (O wins), and 0 otherwise. 
   Have it train itself to play through self-play and Q-learning. Use a table to store the Q-values. 
   Does it achieve an optimal policy?

2) Replace the Q-value table with a functional approximation, such as a neural network. 
   Compare the results of Q-learning using the table representation with those achieved using your functional approximation.
